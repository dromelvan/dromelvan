<h1>Rules</h1>

<p>
  Rule #1: When something occurs that is not explicitly explained in the rules but where
  there is a precedent based on how we've done things in the past, that precedent will
  serve as a rule.
</p>
<p>
  The scoring in the competition is based on the matches in the English Premier League.    
</p>
<p>
  Points scored in rescheduled matches will be counted for the match day the match was
  originally scheduled for. Example: Match day 5 is played on November 10th. The match
  between Arsenal and Aston Villa is rescheduled for March 5th. The points scored in
  that game will be added to the results in match day 5 when the match is played.
</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>
  The teams in the D11 league will play each other twice every season in 38 match days. The team
  that scores the most goals in each match will gain 3 points, the loser will gain 0 points. If
  the game ends in a draw both teams will get 1 point each.
</p>
<p>
  Goals are awarded based on the number of player points the team accumulates in each match.

<p>
  The team with the most points after 38 match days wins the league. If two or more
  teams have the same number of points, the team who's scored the most goals wins.
  If two or more teams still can't be separated, the team who's conceded the most goals wins.
  If a winner still can't be found the league will be decided by a penalty shootout at Nabben stadium.
</p>
<p>
  The fixture list will be made after the draft and published on this website.
</p>
<p>
  Match stats and ratings will be taken from www.whoscored.com. If Whoscored for some reason
  fail to produce stats or ratings then stats will be taken from www.premierleague.com and ratings
  will be taken from www.skysports.com. The stats and ratings will be updated soon after the matches
  are finished but as Whoscored has a habit of updating the ratings after a while the ratings will
  be finalized at approximately 18:00 the day after the match was played.
</p>
<p>
  The Man of the Match (MoM) for each team in a Premier League match will be
  the player with the highest rating on www.whoscored.com. If two players on the same team share
  the highest rating then both of them will be shared MoM. If three or more players on the same team
  share the highest rating then no MoM will be chosen for that team.

<p>
  Additionally, goalkeepers and defenders will receive bonus points or negative points based on the number of goals their team concedes if
  the players participate in the match. Goalkeepers and defenders who do not participate in their teams match for a match day will
  receive one minus point.

<h2>Participation fee</h2>

<p>
  The participation fee is 50 euro. This fee will be used for prize money for the teams finishing in first, second and third place.
  The exact rewards will depend on the number of participating teams. If the competition is full and 20 teams participate, the rewards
  will be 500 euro for first place, 300 euro for second place and 200 euro for third place.
</p>

<h2>The draft</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    The draft will be held at a date close to the start of the season. It has traditionally been held on the thursday before the first match day.
    Time and location will be announced as the start of the season approaches.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be on time! The squad you manage to build in the draft will be in action on the first match day of the season. A preliminary list of available
    players will be provided at this web site.
  </li>
  <li>
    The actual list of available players will be provided at the draft.
  </li>
  <li>
    The number of teams in the competition cannot exceed 20 since there are only 20 teams in the Premier League. In the event that there are more
    than 20 willing owners, 2 owners can register one team as co owners.
  </li>
  <li>
    The draft will be held as an open auction. The owner of last seasons winning team will place the first bid on any of the available players. After this,
    any other owner may place a higher bid on that player, and so on. When noone wants to place a higher bid, the player will be added to the team
    owned by the highest bidder. Once a bid has been placed it cannot be cancelled.
  </li>
  <li>
    All players are unique and each player may only belong to one D11 team.
  </li>
  <li>
    All teams will have Â£50 million to spend on players for their squads.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are no limitations on how many players from the same Premier League team can play for the same D11 team.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are no predetermined fees for any player. The minimum fee for all players is 0,5. A new high bid also has to be
    at least 0,5 higher than the current high bid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each team must have one goalkeeper, four defenders, four midfielders and two forwards in a 4-4-2 formation.
  </li>
  <li>
    It's up to each owner to make sure they can afford the bids they place. If it is noticed that an owner has placed a bid that is higher than he can
    afford or has won bids on too many players for one position, the bidding on the player will be restarted.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The transfer system</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The transfer windows will open at the start of october, december, february and april. The exact date will be announced closer
    to the actual date.
  </li>
  <li>
    At any time before the transfer window opens owners will be able to log in to the web site and transfer list the players
    in their teams. The players will remain in the teams until the transfer window has opened and the owners will
    be able to remove players from the transfer list during this time. Before the deadline each owner will only be able to see
    which players his own team has transfer listed.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the transfer window opens all transfer listed players will be removed from their teams. Once this deadline has passed
    it is too late for owners to regret transfer listing any players. Make sure all the players you want to get rid of and only
    players you want to get rid of are transfer listed when the transfer window opens! If you want to keep a player that
    has been removed from your team you will have to have the high bid for that player in the bidding.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the transfer window has opened owners will be able to log in and place bids on available players. Available players
    are those who did not belong to a D11 team before the transfer window opened and all those who were transfer listed by
    owners before the window opened. Owners will be able to bid on players they've transfer listed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Just like in the draft, all bids must end in .0 or 0.5. Note that you must take into consideration that you have to
    be able to bid 0.5 for each position in your team that you have to fill. If you've transfer listed three players and
    you have 10.0 to spend then the highest bid for each player will be 9.0. The web site will not let you enter bids that
    are too high.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before the deadline for placing bids has passed you will be able to change and/or remove your placed bids. After the
    deadline has passed it is too late to change, add or remove bids. Make sure all your bids are in order before the
    deadline passes.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can place bids on any number of players. If your team, for example, needs two midfielders it will get the first two
    midfielders you have the highest bid on.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can only place one bid on each individual player. This bid is the max fee you're prepared to pay for the player. If your
    placed bid is the highest bid the actual fee you'll pay for the player will be adjusted so that is 0.5 higher than the second
    highest bid. Example: Team A bids 15.0 for player P. The second highest bid is 10.0 from team B. Team A will get the player
    for a fee of 10.5.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bids are handled in player season points order. Bids for the available player that has the most points of all the available
    players on the day of the bidding will be handled first. Bids for the player with the second most points will be handled second and so on.
    If two players have the same number of points their bids will be handled in alphabetical order.
  </li>
  <li>
    The player will join the team with the highest bid. If two or more teams have the same highest bid then the player will join
    the team that is lowest in the table.
  </li>
  <li>
    Funds spent on successful bids will be subtracted from bids that have not yet been handled. Example: Team A can spend 15.0 and bids
    15.0 for player P and 15.0 for player L. Player P has more points than player L so bids on player P are handled first. Team A gets
    player P for 10.5. The highest bid team A can place now is 4.5 so the bid from Team A on player L is adjusted to 4.5.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a team does not manage to fill all its empty positions the owner can try again the next day. The transfer window will remain open
    and the bidding procedure repeated every day until all teams have full squads again.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Premier League match day starts before all teams are full, the unlucky ones will have to play with reduced squads in that
    match day. The competition management will try to make sure there are enough days in a transfer window before the next match day
    so that everyone will have time to fill their squads again.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a match is moved so it's played earlier than the rest of the match day it belongs to and the transfer window, and a D11 team buys a
    player that played in that match then the points for that player in that match will be added to the points of the D11 team for that match day.
  </li>
</ul>
